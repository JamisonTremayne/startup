[My Notes](notes.md)

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] Proper use of Markdown
- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [X] Description of key features
- [X] Description of how you will use each technology
- [X] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Pixel Hoarder is an epic web idle game! The game keeps track of users and progress that they have made, which they can make by gathering pixels! Gathering more pixels allows them to upgrade their graphics card, allowing for more and more pixels to appear, and eventually tools to help them become the Lord of Pixels!

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Makes the structure of the application. Two web pages, one for logging in and one for gameplay.
- **CSS** - Stylization for UI and gameplay.
- **React** - Interactive UI elements, such as clicking on pixels, and also provides login and tribe display.
- **Service** - Backend service which includes the following endpoints:
    - Login
    - Pixel Clicking
    - Upgrade Purchase
    - Tribe Friend Requests
    - Tribe Pixel Gifting
    - Offline Progress Rewards
- **DB/Login** - Stores user data (including usernames, encrypted passwords, etc), authentication tokens for signed in users, and game data of the user (including time stamps, pixel amounts, and purchased upgrades)
- **WebSocket** - When friends within tribes reach certain milestones, notifications are sent to other members of the tribe. Additionally, when giving/receiving gifts from other players, involved members receive notifications.
